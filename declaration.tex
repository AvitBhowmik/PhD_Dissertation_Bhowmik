\label{Declaration}


I herewith declare that I have independently drawn up my Ph.D. dissertation entitled ``Human and Ecological Impacts of Freshwater Degradation on Large Scales. Development and Integration of Spatial Models with Ecological Models for Spatial-ecological Analyses''. All aids and sources have been clearly specified, and the contribution of other scientists or authors have been clearly documented. I have never received any paid assistance by any sort of Ph.D. service agencies. The dissertation has neither identically nor in a similar form been submitted for any scientific examination in Germany or in another country. Moreover, the dissertation has neither earlier nor simultaneously been submitted at any other university or faculty. I am fully aware that the Ph.D. title can be revoked as a result of failure to regard any of the aforementioned points and legal ramifications are also possible.
