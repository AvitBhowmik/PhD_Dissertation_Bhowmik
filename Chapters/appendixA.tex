An R-script ``ATRIC: Automated Accumulation Threshold selection and RIparian Corridor delineation'' is available as a supplementary computer code with the digital version of this thesis that can also be downloaded from: \href{https://github.com/AvitBhowmik/ATRIC}{https://github.com/AvitBhowmik/ATRIC}. To allow for reproducibility, sample data was made available from the following online repositories:\\\href{http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.825001}{http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.825001},\\\href{https://github.com/AvitBhowmik/ATRIC}{https://github.com/AvitBhowmik/ATRIC}.

  \caption{Variable lateral displacements ($d$) search buffers and selected d by optimizing number of digital elevation model (DEM)-derived stream cells ($n_{DS}$) optimization. When variable $d$s were (a) lower and (b) higher than the selected $d$ a lower and higher accumulation thresholds (AT), respectively, were obtained than the AT obtained by the selected $d$.}
